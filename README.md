exemple app for macOS use WKWebView

Embed a WKWebView object programmatically into your view hierarchy, or add it using Interface Builder. Interface Builder supports many customizations, such as configuring data detectors, media playback, and interaction behaviors. For more extensive customizations, create your web view programmatically using a WKWebViewConfiguration object. For example, use a web view configuration object to specify handlers for custom URL schemes, manage cookies, and customize preferences for your web content.
Before your web view appears onscreen, load content from a web server using a URLRequest structure or load content directly from a local file or HTML string. The web view automatically loads embedded resources such as images or videos as part of the initial load request. It then renders your content and displays the results inside the viewâ€™s bounds rectangle. The following code example shows a view controller that replaces its default view with a custom WKWebView object.
